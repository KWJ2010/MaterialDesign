TODO:
1) finish custom formatting for the dictionaries 
	1.1) This includes a default color scheme
	1.2) known issues: Dropdown button on combo box is broken, 
					   font changer needs to be implemented,
					   Tab designs need to be implemented,
					   figure out what is up with scroll bars and fix as needed

2) make second set of dictionaries which reference a color theme object
	2.1) This color theme would function like Colors.xaml, but would work as a UI dev tool to quickly change the color scheme for the app,
		 and as a consumer tool hooked up to a color selector page whre the user could at will pick and set colors to propertiets that the ui is bound to.

3) Finish fleshing out the demo app.
